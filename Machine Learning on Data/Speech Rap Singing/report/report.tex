\section*{Abstract}
I have implemented three different deep learning architecture to learn the 3-output classification of 3 second music clips with a $16kHz$ sample rate. Implementations make use of Librosa for audio-preprocessing, and the Keras environment for model implementation. Labels are learned with a 13-variable MFCC as input data. Results achieved are: @TODO
